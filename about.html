        Hi, my name is Alvaro Eduardo Alvarez Alcorta and I am a programmer. My first introduction to the programming was during a fundamental course of programming in my first year of university where they taught me all the logic of programming in a program called raptor. It was very exciting because from that class it was easier to develop all the logic during the programming.  Since then I've learned various languages and frameworks and built more to-do lists then I can count. I have also worked on different web systems projects.
